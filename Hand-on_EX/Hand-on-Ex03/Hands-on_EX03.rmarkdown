3.1 Learning Outcome
In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.

3.2 Getting Started
First, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:

ggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.
plotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.
DT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.
tidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.
patchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.
The code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.


```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, 
               patchwork, DT, tidyverse) 
```

3.3 Importing Data
In this section, Exam_data.csv provided will be used. Using read_csv() of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.

The code chunk below read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods
ggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.

Interactive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:

Tooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.
Onclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.
Data_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.
If it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.

3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic
Below shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(
    aes(tooltip = ID),
    stackgroups = TRUE, 
    binwidth = 1, 
    method = "histodot") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, 
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(
  ggobj = p,
  width_svg = 6,
  height_svg = 6*0.618
)
```

3.5 Interactivity
3.5.1 Displaying multiple information on tooltip

```{r}
exam_data$tooltip <- c(paste0(     
  "Name = ", exam_data$ID,         
  "\n Class = ", exam_data$CLASS)) 

p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(
    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), 
    stackgroups = TRUE,
    binwidth = 1,
    method = "histodot") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(
  ggobj = p,
  width_svg = 8,
  height_svg = 8*0.618
)
```

  geom_dotplot_interactive(              
    aes(tooltip = ID),                   
    stackgroups = TRUE,                  
    binwidth = 1,                        
    method = "histodot") +               
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(                                  
  ggobj = p,                             
  width_svg = 6,                         
  height_svg = 6*0.618,
  options = list(    #<<
    opts_tooltip(    #<<

}

gg_point <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
                   aes(x = RACE),
) +
  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, 
                   tooltip = after_stat(  
                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  
    fun.data = "mean_se",

4  Programming Animated Statistical Graphics with R


4.1 Overview
When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.

4.1.1 Basic concepts of animation
When creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.



4.1.2 Terminology
Before we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.

Frame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.

Animation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.

Tip
Before you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.

4.2 Getting Started
4.2.1 Loading the R packages
First, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:

plotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.
gganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.
gifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.
gapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.
tidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,
               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)
```


4.2.2 Importing the data
In this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.

Write a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.

```{r}
col <- c("Country", "Continent")
globalPop <- read_xls("data/GlobalPopulation.xls",
                      sheet="Data") %>%
  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))
```

```{r}
col <- c("Country", "Continent")
globalPop <- read_xls("data/GlobalPopulation.xls",
                      sheet="Data") %>%
  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))
```

```{r}
col <- c("Country", "Continent")
globalPop <- read_xls("data/GlobalPopulation.xls",
                      sheet="Data") %>%
  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))
```


4.3 Animated Data Visualisation: gganimate methods
gganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.

transition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.
view_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.
shadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.
enter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.
ease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.
4.3.1 Building a static population bubble plot


```{r}
ggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, 
                      size = Population, 
                      colour = Country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, 
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
       x = '% Aged', 
       y = '% Young') 
```


4.3.2 Building the animated bubble plot
In the code chunk below,

transition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).
ease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.

```{r}
ggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, 
                      size = Population, 
                      colour = Country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, 
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
       x = '% Aged', 
       y = '% Young') +
  transition_time(Year) +       
  ease_aes('linear')          
```


4.4 Animated Data Visualisation: plotly
In Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).

4.4.1 Building an animated bubble plot: ggplotly() method
In this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using ggplotly() method.

```{r}
gg <- ggplot(globalPop, 
       aes(x = Old, 
           y = Young, 
           size = Population, 
           colour = Country)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = Population,
                 frame = Year),
             alpha = 0.7, 
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  labs(x = '% Aged', 
       y = '% Young')

ggplotly(gg)
```

```{r}
gg <- ggplot(globalPop, 
       aes(x = Old, 
           y = Young, 
           size = Population, 
           colour = Country)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = Population,
                 frame = Year),
             alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  labs(x = '% Aged', 
       y = '% Young') + 
  theme(legend.position='none')

ggplotly(gg)
```

3.1 Learning Outcome
In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.

3.2 Getting Started
First, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:

ggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.
plotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.
DT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.
tidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.
patchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.
The code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.


```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, 
               patchwork, DT, tidyverse) 
```

3.3 Importing Data
In this section, Exam_data.csv provided will be used. Using read_csv() of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.

The code chunk below read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods
ggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.

Interactive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:

Tooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.
Onclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.
Data_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.
If it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.

3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic
Below shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(
    aes(tooltip = ID),
    stackgroups = TRUE, 
    binwidth = 1, 
    method = "histodot") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, 
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(
  ggobj = p,
  width_svg = 6,
  height_svg = 6*0.618
)
```

4  Programming Animated Statistical Graphics with R


4.1 Overview
When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.

4.1.1 Basic concepts of animation
When creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.



4.1.2 Terminology
Before we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.

Frame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.

Animation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.

Tip
Before you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.

4.2 Getting Started
4.2.1 Loading the R packages
First, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:

plotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.
gganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.
gifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.
gapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.
tidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,
               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)
```


4.2.2 Importing the data
In this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.

Write a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.

```{r}
col <- c("Country", "Continent")
globalPop <- read_xls("data/GlobalPopulation.xls",
                      sheet="Data") %>%
  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))
```

```{r}
col <- c("Country", "Continent")
globalPop <- read_xls("data/GlobalPopulation.xls",
                      sheet="Data") %>%
  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))
```

```{r}
col <- c("Country", "Continent")
globalPop <- read_xls("data/GlobalPopulation.xls",
                      sheet="Data") %>%
  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))
```


4.3 Animated Data Visualisation: gganimate methods
gganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.

transition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.
view_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.
shadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.
enter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.
ease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.
4.3.1 Building a static population bubble plot


```{r}
ggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, 
                      size = Population, 
                      colour = Country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, 
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
       x = '% Aged', 
       y = '% Young') 
```


4.3.2 Building the animated bubble plot
In the code chunk below,

transition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).
ease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.

```{r}
ggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, 
                      size = Population, 
                      colour = Country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, 
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
       x = '% Aged', 
       y = '% Young') +
  transition_time(Year) +       
  ease_aes('linear')          
```


4.4 Animated Data Visualisation: plotly
In Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).

4.4.1 Building an animated bubble plot: ggplotly() method
In this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using ggplotly() method.

```{r}
gg <- ggplot(globalPop, 
       aes(x = Old, 
           y = Young, 
           size = Population, 
           colour = Country)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = Population,
                 frame = Year),
             alpha = 0.7, 
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  labs(x = '% Aged', 
       y = '% Young')

ggplotly(gg)
```

```{r}
gg <- ggplot(globalPop, 
       aes(x = Old, 
           y = Young, 
           size = Population, 
           colour = Country)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = Population,
                 frame = Year),
             alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  labs(x = '% Aged', 
       y = '% Young') + 
  theme(legend.position='none')

ggplotly(gg)

4.4.2 Building an animated bubble plot: plot_ly() method

```{r}
bp <- globalPop %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~Old, 
          y = ~Young, 
          size = ~Population, 
          color = ~Continent,
          sizes = c(2, 100),
          frame = ~Year, 
          text = ~Country, 
          hoverinfo = "text",
          type = 'scatter',
          mode = 'markers'
          ) %>%
  layout(showlegend = FALSE)
bp
