    "text": "There are two major residential property market in Singapore, namely public and private housing. Public housing aims to meet the basic need of the general public with monthly household income less than or equal to S$14,000. For families with monthly household income more than S$14,000, they need to turn to the private residential market.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish the task, transaction data of REALIS will be used.

This focus on resale properties is crucial as it offers a snapshot of the market’s secondary transactions, reflecting ongoing demand and providing a real-world gauge of property values after the initial purchase. Resale data represents an essential segment of the housing market, often characterized by immediate habitability and established neighborhoods, crucial factors for many homebuyers and investors in making informed decisions.\n\n\nSale Date:\nThe Sale Date variable is crucial in housing price analysis for monitoring temporal patterns. It allows analysts to track how prices change over time, revealing trends that may correspond to economic conditions, interest rates, or seasonal fluctuations. By examining the Sale Date, one can also discern if there are particular times of the year when the market peaks or dips, which can be invaluable for both buyers looking for the best deal and sellers aiming for the optimal listing period.\nArea and Unit Price:\nOn the other hand, Area (SQM). and Unit Price ($ PSM). provide spatial and valuation metrics, respectively. The area of a property, often measured in square meters, directly influences its utility and potential for future modifications, affecting its market value. The unit price per square meter standardizes property values, making it possible to compare homes of different sizes and locations fairly. This metric is essential to understand what drives value in the housing market and to identify whether buyers are getting a reasonable price for the area they are purchasing in.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Quarter = as.yearqtr(`Sale Date`))\n\navg_price_by_quarter_resale &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Area_Category, Quarter) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Avg_Unit_Price_PSM = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\np_line_resale &lt;- avg_price_by_quarter_resale %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Avg_Unit_Price_PSM, group = Area_Category, color = Area_Category)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Quarterly Average Unit Price ($ PSM) by Area Category for Resale\",\n       x = \"Quarter\",\n       y = \"Average Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\np_line_resale_stacked &lt;- p_line_resale + facet_wrap(~Area_Category, ncol = 1, scales = \"free_y\")\n\ndata_q1_resale &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Quarter == \"2024 Q1\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = floor_date(`Sale Date`, \"month\"))\n\np_box_resale &lt;- ggplot(data_q1_resale, aes(x = Area_Category, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, fill = Area_Category)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.001) +  # Adjusting alpha for visibility\n  facet_wrap(~Month, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Monthly Unit Price ($ PSM) by Area Category for Resale (Q1 2024)\",\n       x = \"Area Category\",\n       y = \"Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\np_combined_resale &lt;- p_line_resale_stacked / p_box_resale\n\n\n\n\nprint(p_combined_resale)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the resale housing market, the quarterly average unit price per square meter (PSM) exhibits contrasting trends: smaller properties (&lt;200 SQM) are gaining value, while larger ones (≥300 SQM) show price declines, indicating a shift in consumer preferences toward more compact living spaces. The Q1 2024 box plots reveal a broad price range within each area category, especially in the largest homes, suggesting that factors like location and amenities significantly influence pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Name:\nThe variable Project.Name represents the specific housing development or project. Analyzing data by Project.Name allows for a detailed understanding of the popularity and demand for specific developments. This can highlight developers’ reputation, location desirability, and unique features of individual projects that may influence prices. Trends can emerge, such as certain developers commanding premium prices or projects in specific locations being more sought-after.\nTotal Units and Avg Unit Price PSM:\nTotal_Units and Avg_Unit_Price_PSM are key metrics for assessing supply and value. Total_Units sold provides insight into the scale of a project and its market absorption rate. High sales volumes can indicate high demand or effective pricing strategies, while low volumes may signal overpricing or less desirable attributes. Avg_Unit_Price_PSM (average unit price per square meter) offers a comparative value indicator that normalizes prices across different sizes and types of properties, reflecting the price point at which the market clears. Analyzing this alongside Total_Units can reveal if there’s a relationship between the number of units sold and the price points, potentially guiding future development and pricing strategies.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\nproject_stats &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(`Project Name` != \"N.A.\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Project Name`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Units = sum(`Number of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Sum up all units for each project\n    Avg_Unit_Price = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Calculate the average price per square meter\n    .groups = \"drop\"  # Drop the grouping\n  )\n\ntop_projects &lt;- project_stats %&gt;%\n  top_n(25, Total_Units) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total_Units))\n\nproject_order &lt;- top_projects$`Project Name`\n\ntop_projects$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(top_projects$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\nresale_data$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(resale_data$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\n\np_units &lt;- ggplot(top_projects, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = Total_Units, fill = 'steelblue')) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(y = \"Total Number of Units\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\np_price &lt;- ggplot(resale_data, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Unit Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\np_combined &lt;- p_units | p_price\n\n\n\n\np_combined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart depicts a significant lead in the total number of units sold by “Sol Acres,” suggesting a high demand or larger inventory. Other projects show a steady decrease in volume, indicating varied market preferences. The box plot showcases consistent unit price ranges within most projects, with notable premiums in “The Sail @ Marina Bay” and “Reflections at Keppel Bay,” likely due to their desirable locations or upscale amenities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data from the first quarter of 2024 shows that “Sol Acres” significantly leads in resale volumes, hinting at its market desirability, possibly due to a balance of affordability and attractive amenities. This project’s success may be a key indicator for those seeking value-for-money investments. In contrast, luxury segments like “The Sail @ Marina Bay” exhibit a wide price range, indicating a market for buyers with a taste for exclusivity and willingness to pay a premium for distinctive features.\nFor Consumers: Buyers should align their choices with their priorities: affordability may lead them to high-volume projects, while unique, high-quality features could draw them towards premium segments. When considering investment, a diversified approach that includes stable, high-volume properties and selective, high-value opportunities may offer balanced returns.\n\n\n\n\nURA releases flash estimate of 1st Quarter 2024 private residential property price index\nUnsold private housing stock on the rise ahead of ramp-up in new launches in 2024\nHDB resale prices rise 1.7%; private home prices up 1.5% in first quarter: Flash estimates"

    "text": "The visualizations specifically highlight resale data within Singapore’s private residential market for the first quarter of 2024. This focus on resale properties is crucial as it offers a snapshot of the market’s secondary transactions, reflecting ongoing demand and providing a real-world gauge of property values after the initial purchase. Resale data represents an essential segment of the housing market, often characterized by immediate habitability and established neighborhoods, crucial factors for many homebuyers and investors in making informed decisions.\n\n\nSale Date:\nThe Sale Date variable is crucial in housing price analysis for monitoring temporal patterns. It allows analysts to track how prices change over time, revealing trends that may correspond to economic conditions, interest rates, or seasonal fluctuations. By examining the Sale Date, one can also discern if there are particular times of the year when the market peaks or dips, which can be invaluable for both buyers looking for the best deal and sellers aiming for the optimal listing period.\nArea and Unit Price:\nOn the other hand, Area (SQM). and Unit Price ($ PSM). provide spatial and valuation metrics, respectively. The area of a property, often measured in square meters, directly influences its utility and potential for future modifications, affecting its market value. The unit price per square meter standardizes property values, making it possible to compare homes of different sizes and locations fairly. This metric is essential to understand what drives value in the housing market and to identify whether buyers are getting a reasonable price for the area they are purchasing in.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Quarter = as.yearqtr(`Sale Date`))\n\navg_price_by_quarter_resale &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Area_Category, Quarter) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Avg_Unit_Price_PSM = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\np_line_resale &lt;- avg_price_by_quarter_resale %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Avg_Unit_Price_PSM, group = Area_Category, color = Area_Category)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Quarterly Average Unit Price ($ PSM) by Area Category for Resale\",\n       x = \"Quarter\",\n       y = \"Average Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\np_line_resale_stacked &lt;- p_line_resale + facet_wrap(~Area_Category, ncol = 1, scales = \"free_y\")\n\ndata_q1_resale &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Quarter == \"2024 Q1\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = floor_date(`Sale Date`, \"month\"))\n\np_box_resale &lt;- ggplot(data_q1_resale, aes(x = Area_Category, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, fill = Area_Category)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.001) +  # Adjusting alpha for visibility\n  facet_wrap(~Month, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Monthly Unit Price ($ PSM) by Area Category for Resale (Q1 2024)\",\n       x = \"Area Category\",\n       y = \"Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\np_combined_resale &lt;- p_line_resale_stacked / p_box_resale\n\n\n\n\nprint(p_combined_resale)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the resale housing market, the quarterly average unit price per square meter (PSM) exhibits contrasting trends: smaller properties (&lt;200 SQM) are gaining value, while larger ones (≥300 SQM) show price declines, indicating a shift in consumer preferences toward more compact living spaces. The Q1 2024 box plots reveal a broad price range within each area category, especially in the largest homes, suggesting that factors like location and amenities significantly influence pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Name:\nThe variable Project.Name represents the specific housing development or project. Analyzing data by Project.Name allows for a detailed understanding of the popularity and demand for specific developments. This can highlight developers’ reputation, location desirability, and unique features of individual projects that may influence prices. Trends can emerge, such as certain developers commanding premium prices or projects in specific locations being more sought-after.\nTotal Units and Avg Unit Price PSM:\nTotal_Units and Avg_Unit_Price_PSM are key metrics for assessing supply and value. Total_Units sold provides insight into the scale of a project and its market absorption rate. High sales volumes can indicate high demand or effective pricing strategies, while low volumes may signal overpricing or less desirable attributes. Avg_Unit_Price_PSM (average unit price per square meter) offers a comparative value indicator that normalizes prices across different sizes and types of properties, reflecting the price point at which the market clears. Analyzing this alongside Total_Units can reveal if there’s a relationship between the number of units sold and the price points, potentially guiding future development and pricing strategies.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\nproject_stats &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(`Project Name` != \"N.A.\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Project Name`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Units = sum(`Number of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Sum up all units for each project\n    Avg_Unit_Price = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Calculate the average price per square meter\n    .groups = \"drop\"  # Drop the grouping\n  )\n\ntop_projects &lt;- project_stats %&gt;%\n  top_n(25, Total_Units) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total_Units))\n\nproject_order &lt;- top_projects$`Project Name`\n\ntop_projects$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(top_projects$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\nresale_data$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(resale_data$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\n\np_units &lt;- ggplot(top_projects, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = Total_Units, fill = 'steelblue')) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(y = \"Total Number of Units\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\np_price &lt;- ggplot(resale_data, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Unit Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\np_combined &lt;- p_units | p_price\n\n\n\n\np_combined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart depicts a significant lead in the total number of units sold by “Sol Acres,” suggesting a high demand or larger inventory. Other projects show a steady decrease in volume, indicating varied market preferences. The box plot showcases consistent unit price ranges within most projects, with notable premiums in “The Sail @ Marina Bay” and “Reflections at Keppel Bay,” likely due to their desirable locations or upscale amenities."

    "text": "The data from the first quarter of 2024 shows that “Sol Acres” significantly leads in resale volumes, hinting at its market desirability, possibly due to a balance of affordability and attractive amenities. This project’s success may be a key indicator for those seeking value-for-money investments. In contrast, luxury segments like “The Sail @ Marina Bay” exhibit a wide price range, indicating a market for buyers with a taste for exclusivity and willingness to pay a premium for distinctive features.\nFor Consumers: Buyers should align their choices with their priorities: affordability may lead them to high-volume projects, while unique, high-quality features could draw them towards premium segments. When considering investment, a diversified approach that includes stable, high-volume properties and selective, high-value opportunities may offer balanced returns."

challenges. Primarily, it limits the depth of market trend analysis over an extended period, potentially overlooking seasonal fluctuations and economic cycles that significantly influence real estate markets. Without this broader temporal context, the analysis might give undue emphasis to short-term variations or isolated events, potentially leading to a somewhat narrow perspective on market dynamics. Such a limitation curtails the capacity to observe and interpret long-term trends and the cyclical nature of the housing market, which are essential for comprehensive statistical analysis and forecasting.\nFurthermore, the lack of previous year data restricts year-over-year comparative analysis, crucial for evaluating market condition changes and understanding the influence of external economic factors like interest rate shifts or broader economic changes. For investors and policymakers, the unavailability of a more extended data range may hinder informed strategic decision-making. It limits the development of predictive models that rely on historical data to accurately project future market behaviors, thereby subtly reducing the analysis’s overall utility in supporting nuanced business and investment decisions.\nTo address the challenges of a limited temporal analysis, I have enhanced the dataset by incorporating data from the previous year and categorizing it by quarters. This addition allows for a more nuanced exploration of the changes and trends over time. By analyzing the data on a quarterly basis, we can better understand the seasonal fluctuations and the impact of economic cycles on the real estate market.\n::: panel-tabset ## Code\n\nP3_interactive &lt;- plot_ly(data = data_cleaned, x = ~`Area (SQM)`, y = ~`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',\n                          hoverinfo = 'text',\n                          transforms = list(\n                            list(\n                              type = 'filter',\n                              target = ~Quarter,\n                              operation = '=',\n                              value = unique(data_cleaned$Quarter)[1]  \n                            )\n                          ),\n                          text = ~paste(\"Price: \", `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, \"$/sqm&lt;br&gt;Area: \", `Area (SQM)`, \"sqm&lt;br&gt;Quarter: \", Quarter)) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Interactive Scatter Plot of Unit Price vs. Area by Category',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Area (SQM)'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'Unit Price ($ PSM)'),\n         sliders = list(list(\n           active = 0,\n           currentvalue = list(prefix = \"Quarter: \"),\n           steps = lapply(unique(data_cleaned$Quarter), function(q) {\n             list(label = q, method = \"restyle\", args = list(\"transforms[0].value\", q))\n           })\n         )))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP3_interactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive scatter plot offers several advantages over the static scatter plot with a trend line, particularly in terms of user engagement and analytical depth. Firstly, its interactivity enhances user experience by allowing for the exploration of individual data points through tooltips and dynamic elements such as sliders for temporal data filtering. This interactivity not only makes the data more accessible but also enables users to perform on-the-fly analysis of specific time periods without the need to switch between different plots. Moreover, the ability to zoom in and navigate through dense clusters of data points helps in examining detailed patterns that might be obscured in a static plot. This dynamic functionality is especially valuable in digital platforms where users expect an interactive and engaging data visualization experience.\n\n\nFailing to categorize data by “Type of Sale” in an analysis of real estate transactions introduces significant limitations that can obscure crucial insights into different market segments. Without this categorization, the analysis merges various types of transactions, such as new sales, resales, and sub-sales, into a single aggregated dataset. This aggregation can lead to a generalized overview that fails to capture the distinct behaviors and trends associated with each sale type.\nFirstly, different sale types often exhibit unique pricing patterns, demand cycles, and buyer preferences. For instance, new sales might be influenced by developer promotions and economic incentives, while resales are impacted more by the existing housing market conditions. Sub-sales, involving properties sold before their construction completion, might fluctuate based on speculative market sentiments. Without distinguishing these types, strategic decision-making becomes challenging as the nuanced dynamics of the market are not adequately represented.\nMoreover, policies and marketing strategies tailored to specific sale types cannot be effectively formulated or implemented without a clear understanding of the particular characteristics and needs of each segment. For example, marketing strategies that are effective for new developments might not work for resales. Therefore, by not categorizing data by “Type of Sale,” the analysis loses the potential to guide targeted interventions and optimize resource allocation, potentially leading to less effective strategies and missed opportunities in the market.\nTo enhance our analysis, I’ve processed the data to categorize it by different “Type of Sale.” This categorization allows us to delve into the specific characteristics and trends of new sales, resales, and sub-sales separately.\n::: panel-tabset ## Code\n\nP3_interactive &lt;- plot_ly(data = data_cleaned, x = ~`Area (SQM)`, y = ~`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',\n                          hoverinfo = 'text',\n                          transforms = list(\n                            list(\n                              type = 'filter',\n                              target = ~Quarter,\n                              operation = '=',\n                              value = unique(data_cleaned$Quarter)[1]  \n                            ),\n                            list(\n                              type = 'filter',\n                              target = ~`Type of Sale`,\n                              operation = '=',\n                              value = unique(data_cleaned$`Type of Sale`)[1] \n                            )\n                          ),\n                          text = ~paste(\"Price: \", `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, \"$/sqm&lt;br&gt;Area: \", `Area (SQM)`, \"sqm&lt;br&gt;Quarter: \", Quarter, \"&lt;br&gt;Type of Sale: \", `Type of Sale`)) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Interactive Scatter Plot of Unit Price vs. Area by Category',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Area (SQM)'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'Unit Price ($ PSM)'),\n         updatemenus = list(\n           list(\n             type = \"dropdown\",\n             direction = \"down\",\n             showactive = TRUE,\n             buttons = lapply(unique(data_cleaned$`Type of Sale`), function(type) {\n               list(\n                 method = \"restyle\",\n                 args = list(\"transforms[1].value\", type),  \n                 label = type\n               )\n             })\n           )\n         ),\n         sliders = list(list(\n           active = 0,\n           currentvalue = list(prefix = \"Quarter: \"),\n           steps = lapply(unique(data_cleaned$Quarter), function(q) {\n             list(\n               label = q,\n               method = \"restyle\",\n               args = list(\"transforms[0].value\", q)  \n             )\n           })\n         )))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP3_interactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe updated interactive scatter plot enhances data analysis capabilities significantly by incorporating dropdown menus for category-based filtering, such as transaction types (New Sale, Resale, Sub Sale). This feature allows users to segment the dataset on the fly, enabling a focused examination of trends and patterns specific to each category. Such granularity is invaluable for users needing to make nuanced assessments of market dynamics. Furthermore, the plot’s clear presentation even in high-density areas ensures that all data points are easily visible and distinguishable, avoiding any visual confusion and facilitating precise analysis. Enhanced interactivity, provided by the dropdown filters, improves the user experience by allowing dynamic and complex data segmentation within the visualization interface itself. This makes the plot a highly effective tool for stakeholders requiring a comprehensive and detailed view of various market conditions without the need for additional tools or programming efforts."

    "text": "The absence of data from the previous year’s four quarters in the scatter plot analyzing the relationship between transacted prices and area poses certain challenges. Primarily, it limits the depth of market trend analysis over an extended period, potentially overlooking seasonal fluctuations and economic cycles that significantly influence real estate markets. Without this broader temporal context, the analysis might give undue emphasis to short-term variations or isolated events, potentially leading to a somewhat narrow perspective on market dynamics. Such a limitation curtails the capacity to observe and interpret long-term trends and the cyclical nature of the housing market, which are essential for comprehensive statistical analysis and forecasting.\nFurthermore, the lack of previous year data restricts year-over-year comparative analysis, crucial for evaluating market condition changes and understanding the influence of external economic factors like interest rate shifts or broader economic changes. For investors and policymakers, the unavailability of a more extended data range may hinder informed strategic decision-making. It limits the development of predictive models that rely on historical data to accurately project future market behaviors, thereby subtly reducing the analysis’s overall utility in supporting nuanced business and investment decisions.\nTo address the challenges of a limited temporal analysis, I have enhanced the dataset by incorporating data from the previous year and categorizing it by quarters. This addition allows for a more nuanced exploration of the changes and trends over time. By analyzing the data on a quarterly basis, we can better understand the seasonal fluctuations and the impact of economic cycles on the real estate market.\n::: panel-tabset ## Code\n\nP3_interactive &lt;- plot_ly(data = data_cleaned, x = ~`Area (SQM)`, y = ~`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',\n                          hoverinfo = 'text',\n                          transforms = list(\n                            list(\n                              type = 'filter',\n                              target = ~Quarter,\n                              operation = '=',\n                              value = unique(data_cleaned$Quarter)[1]  \n                            )\n                          ),\n                          text = ~paste(\"Price: \", `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, \"$/sqm&lt;br&gt;Area: \", `Area (SQM)`, \"sqm&lt;br&gt;Quarter: \", Quarter)) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Interactive Scatter Plot of Unit Price vs. Area by Category',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Area (SQM)'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'Unit Price ($ PSM)'),\n         sliders = list(list(\n           active = 0,\n           currentvalue = list(prefix = \"Quarter: \"),\n           steps = lapply(unique(data_cleaned$Quarter), function(q) {\n             list(label = q, method = \"restyle\", args = list(\"transforms[0].value\", q))\n           })\n         )))"

    "text": "The interactive scatter plot offers several advantages over the static scatter plot with a trend line, particularly in terms of user engagement and analytical depth. Firstly, its interactivity enhances user experience by allowing for the exploration of individual data points through tooltips and dynamic elements such as sliders for temporal data filtering. This interactivity not only makes the data more accessible but also enables users to perform on-the-fly analysis of specific time periods without the need to switch between different plots. Moreover, the ability to zoom in and navigate through dense clusters of data points helps in examining detailed patterns that might be obscured in a static plot. This dynamic functionality is especially valuable in digital platforms where users expect an interactive and engaging data visualization experience.\n\n\nFailing to categorize data by “Type of Sale” in an analysis of real estate transactions introduces significant limitations that can obscure crucial insights into different market segments. Without this categorization, the analysis merges various types of transactions, such as new sales, resales, and sub-sales, into a single aggregated dataset. This aggregation can lead to a generalized overview that fails to capture the distinct behaviors and trends associated with each sale type.\nFirstly, different sale types often exhibit unique pricing patterns, demand cycles, and buyer preferences. For instance, new sales might be influenced by developer promotions and economic incentives, while resales are impacted more by the existing housing market conditions. Sub-sales, involving properties sold before their construction completion, might fluctuate based on speculative market sentiments. Without distinguishing these types, strategic decision-making becomes challenging as the nuanced dynamics of the market are not adequately represented.\nMoreover, policies and marketing strategies tailored to specific sale types cannot be effectively formulated or implemented without a clear understanding of the particular characteristics and needs of each segment. For example, marketing strategies that are effective for new developments might not work for resales. Therefore, by not categorizing data by “Type of Sale,” the analysis loses the potential to guide targeted interventions and optimize resource allocation, potentially leading to less effective strategies and missed opportunities in the market.\nTo enhance our analysis, I’ve processed the data to categorize it by different “Type of Sale.” This categorization allows us to delve into the specific characteristics and trends of new sales, resales, and sub-sales separately.\n::: panel-tabset ## Code\n\nP3_interactive &lt;- plot_ly(data = data_cleaned, x = ~`Area (SQM)`, y = ~`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',\n                          hoverinfo = 'text',\n                          transforms = list(\n                            list(\n                              type = 'filter',\n                              target = ~Quarter,\n                              operation = '=',\n                              value = unique(data_cleaned$Quarter)[1]  \n                            ),\n                            list(\n                              type = 'filter',\n                              target = ~`Type of Sale`,\n                              operation = '=',\n                              value = unique(data_cleaned$`Type of Sale`)[1] \n                            )\n                          ),\n                          text = ~paste(\"Price: \", `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, \"$/sqm&lt;br&gt;Area: \", `Area (SQM)`, \"sqm&lt;br&gt;Quarter: \", Quarter, \"&lt;br&gt;Type of Sale: \", `Type of Sale`)) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Interactive Scatter Plot of Unit Price vs. Area by Category',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Area (SQM)'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'Unit Price ($ PSM)'),\n         updatemenus = list(\n           list(\n             type = \"dropdown\",\n             direction = \"down\",\n             showactive = TRUE,\n             buttons = lapply(unique(data_cleaned$`Type of Sale`), function(type) {\n               list(\n                 method = \"restyle\",\n                 args = list(\"transforms[1].value\", type),  \n                 label = type\n               )\n             })\n           )\n         ),\n         sliders = list(list(\n           active = 0,\n           currentvalue = list(prefix = \"Quarter: \"),\n           steps = lapply(unique(data_cleaned$Quarter), function(q) {\n             list(\n               label = q,\n               method = \"restyle\",\n               args = list(\"transforms[0].value\", q)  \n             )\n           })\n         )))"

    "text": "The updated interactive scatter plot enhances data analysis capabilities significantly by incorporating dropdown menus for category-based filtering, such as transaction types (New Sale, Resale, Sub Sale). This feature allows users to segment the dataset on the fly, enabling a focused examination of trends and patterns specific to each category. Such granularity is invaluable for users needing to make nuanced assessments of market dynamics. Furthermore, the plot’s clear presentation even in high-density areas ensures that all data points are easily visible and distinguishable, avoiding any visual confusion and facilitating precise analysis. Enhanced interactivity, provided by the dropdown filters, improves the user experience by allowing dynamic and complex data segmentation within the visualization interface itself. This makes the plot a highly effective tool for stakeholders requiring a comprehensive and detailed view of various market conditions without the need for additional tools or programming efforts."
