This approach may not provide an accurate reflection of the specific market conditions of early 2024, as it includes data from various time periods with potentially different economic influences. Additionally, the plot does not differentiate between types of sales, such as new homes, resales, or foreclosures, which can vary significantly in pricing dynamics. This aggregation could obscure distinct patterns and trends that are more apparent when analyzing these groups separately, leading to less precise insights for targeted strategic decision-making or

quarters in the scatter plot analyzing the relationship between transacted prices and area poses certain challenges. Primarily, it limits the depth of market trend analysis over an extended period, potentially overlooking seasonal fluctuations and economic cycles that significantly influence real estate markets. Without this broader temporal context, the analysis might give undue emphasis to short-term variations or isolated events, potentially leading to a somewhat narrow perspective on market dynamics. Such a limitation curtails the capacity to observe and interpret long-term trends and the cyclical nature of the housing market, which are essential for comprehensive statistical analysis and forecasting.\nFurthermore, the lack of previous year data restricts year-over-year comparative analysis, crucial for evaluating market condition changes and understanding the influence of external economic factors like interest rate shifts or broader economic changes. For investors and policymakers, the unavailability of a more extended data range may hinder informed strategic decision-making. It limits the development of predictive models that rely on historical data to accurately project future market behaviors, thereby subtly reducing the analysis’s overall utility in supporting nuanced business and investment decisions.\nTo address the challenges of a limited temporal analysis, I have enhanced the dataset by incorporating data from the previous year and categorizing it by quarters. This addition allows for a more nuanced exploration of the changes and trends over time. By analyzing the data on a quarterly basis, we can better understand the seasonal fluctuations and the impact of economic cycles on the real estate market.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nP3_interactive &lt;- plot_ly(data = data_cleaned, x = ~`Area (SQFT)`, y = ~`Transacted Price ($)`, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',\n                          hoverinfo = 'text',\n                          transforms = list(\n                            list(\n                              type = 'filter',\n                              target = ~Quarter,\n                              operation = '=',\n                              value = unique(data_cleaned$Quarter)[1]  \n                            )\n                          ),\n                          text = ~paste(\"Price: \", `Transacted Price ($)`, \"&lt;br&gt;Area: \", `Area (SQFT)`, \"&lt;br&gt;Quarter: \", Quarter)) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Scatter Plot of Transacted Price vs. Area',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Area (SQFT)'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'Transacted Price ($)'),\n         sliders = list(list(\n           active = 0,\n           currentvalue = list(prefix = \"Quarter: \"),\n           steps = lapply(unique(data_cleaned$Quarter), function(q) {\n             list(label = q, method = \"restyle\", args = list(\"transforms[0].value\", q))\n           })\n         )))\n\n\n\n\nP3_interactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive scatter plot offers several advantages over the static scatter plot with a trend line, particularly in terms of user engagement and analytical depth. Firstly, its interactivity enhances user experience by allowing for the exploration of individual data points through tooltips and dynamic elements such as sliders for temporal data filtering. This interactivity not only makes the data more accessible but also enables users to perform on-the-fly analysis of specific time periods without the need to switch between different plots. Moreover, the ability to zoom in and navigate through dense clusters of data points helps in examining detailed patterns that might be obscured in a static plot. This dynamic functionality is especially valuable in digital platforms where users expect an interactive and engaging data visualization experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailing to categorize data by “Type of Sale” in an analysis of real estate transactions introduces significant limitations that can obscure crucial insights into different market segments. Without this categorization, the analysis merges various types of transactions, such as new sales, resales, and sub-sales, into a single aggregated dataset. This aggregation can lead to a generalized overview that fails to capture the distinct behaviors and trends associated with each sale type.\nFirstly, different sale types often exhibit unique pricing patterns, demand cycles, and buyer preferences. For instance, new sales might be influenced by developer promotions and economic incentives, while resales are impacted more by the existing housing market conditions. Sub-sales, involving properties sold before their construction completion, might fluctuate based on speculative market sentiments. Without distinguishing these types, strategic decision-making becomes challenging as the nuanced dynamics of the market are not adequately represented.\nMoreover, policies and marketing strategies tailored to specific sale types cannot be effectively formulated or implemented without a clear understanding of the particular characteristics and needs of each segment. For example, marketing strategies that are effective for new developments might not work for resales. Therefore, by not categorizing data by “Type of Sale,” the analysis loses the potential to guide targeted interventions and optimize resource allocation, potentially leading to less effective strategies and missed opportunities in the market.\nTo enhance our analysis, I’ve processed the data to categorize it by different “Type of Sale.” This categorization allows us to delve into the specific characteristics and trends of new sales, resales, and sub-sales separately.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nP3_interactive &lt;- plot_ly(data = data_cleaned, x = ~`Area (SQFT)`, y = ~`Transacted Price ($)`, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',\n                          hoverinfo = 'text',\n                          transforms = list(\n                            list(\n                              type = 'filter',\n                              target = ~Quarter,\n                              operation = '=',\n                              value = unique(data_cleaned$Quarter)[1] \n                            ),\n                            list(\n                              type = 'filter',\n                              target = ~`Type of Sale`,\n                              operation = '=',\n                              value = unique(data_cleaned$`Type of Sale`)[1] \n                            )\n                          ),\n                          text = ~paste(\"Price: \", `Transacted Price ($)`, \"&lt;br&gt;Area: \", `Area (SQFT)`, \"&lt;br&gt;Quarter: \", Quarter, \"&lt;br&gt;Type of Sale: \", `Type of Sale`)) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Scatter Plot of Transacted Price vs. Area',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Area (SQFT)'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'Transacted Price ($)'),\n         updatemenus = list(\n           list(\n             type = \"dropdown\",\n             direction = \"down\",\n             showactive = TRUE,\n             buttons = lapply(unique(data_cleaned$`Type of Sale`), function(type) {\n               list(\n                 method = \"restyle\",\n                 args = list(\"transforms[1].value\", type),\n                 label = type\n               )\n             })\n           )\n         ),\n         sliders = list(list(\n           active = 0,\n           currentvalue = list(prefix = \"Quarter: \"),\n           steps = lapply(unique(data_cleaned$Quarter), function(q) {\n             list(\n               label = q,\n               method = \"restyle\",\n               args = list(\"transforms[0].value\", q)  \n             )\n           })\n         )))\n\n\n\n\nP3_interactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe updated interactive scatter plot enhances data analysis capabilities significantly by incorporating dropdown menus for category-based filtering, such as transaction types (New Sale, Resale, Sub Sale).

    "text": "The absence of data from the previous year’s four quarters in the scatter plot analyzing the relationship between transacted prices and area poses certain challenges. Primarily, it limits the depth of market trend analysis over an extended period, potentially overlooking seasonal fluctuations and economic cycles that significantly influence real estate markets. Without this broader temporal context, the analysis might give undue emphasis to short-term variations or isolated events, potentially leading to a somewhat narrow perspective on market dynamics. Such a limitation curtails the capacity to observe and interpret long-term trends and the cyclical nature of the housing market, which are essential for comprehensive statistical analysis and forecasting.\nFurthermore, the lack of previous year data restricts year-over-year comparative analysis, crucial for evaluating market condition changes and understanding the influence of external economic factors like interest rate shifts or broader economic changes. For investors and policymakers, the unavailability of a more extended data range may hinder informed strategic decision-making. It limits the development of predictive models that rely on historical data to accurately project future market behaviors, thereby subtly reducing the analysis’s overall utility in supporting nuanced business and investment decisions.\nTo address the challenges of a limited temporal analysis, I have enhanced the dataset by incorporating data from the previous year and categorizing it by quarters. This addition allows for a more nuanced exploration of the changes and trends over time. By analyzing the data on a quarterly basis, we can better understand the seasonal fluctuations and the impact of economic cycles on the real estate market.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nP3_interactive &lt;- plot_ly(data = data_cleaned, x = ~`Area (SQFT)`, y = ~`Transacted Price ($)`, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',\n                          hoverinfo = 'text',\n                          transforms = list(\n                            list(\n                              type = 'filter',\n                              target = ~Quarter,\n                              operation = '=',\n                              value = unique(data_cleaned$Quarter)[1]  \n                            )\n                          ),\n                          text = ~paste(\"Price: \", `Transacted Price ($)`, \"&lt;br&gt;Area: \", `Area (SQFT)`, \"&lt;br&gt;Quarter: \", Quarter)) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Scatter Plot of Transacted Price vs. Area',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Area (SQFT)'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'Transacted Price ($)'),\n         sliders = list(list(\n           active = 0,\n           currentvalue = list(prefix = \"Quarter: \"),\n           steps = lapply(unique(data_cleaned$Quarter), function(q) {\n             list(label = q, method = \"restyle\", args = list(\"transforms[0].value\", q))\n           })\n         )))\n\n\n\n\nP3_interactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive scatter plot offers several advantages over the static scatter plot with a trend line, particularly in terms of user engagement and analytical depth. Firstly, its interactivity enhances user experience by allowing for the exploration of individual data points through tooltips and dynamic elements such as sliders for temporal data filtering. This interactivity not only makes the data more accessible but also enables users to perform on-the-fly analysis of specific time periods without the need to switch between different plots. Moreover, the ability to zoom in and navigate through dense clusters of data points helps in examining detailed patterns that might be obscured in a static plot. This dynamic functionality is especially valuable in digital platforms where users expect an interactive and engaging data visualization experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailing to categorize data by “Type of Sale” in an analysis of real estate transactions introduces significant limitations that can obscure crucial insights into different market segments. Without this categorization, the analysis merges various types of transactions, such as new sales, resales, and sub-sales, into a single aggregated dataset. This aggregation can lead to a generalized overview that fails to capture the distinct behaviors and trends associated with each sale type.\nFirstly, different sale types often exhibit unique pricing patterns, demand cycles, and buyer preferences. For instance, new sales might be influenced by developer promotions and economic incentives, while resales are impacted more by the existing housing market conditions. Sub-sales, involving properties sold before their construction completion, might fluctuate based on speculative market sentiments. Without distinguishing these types, strategic decision-making becomes challenging as the nuanced dynamics of the market are not adequately represented.\nMoreover, policies and marketing strategies tailored to specific sale types cannot be effectively formulated or implemented without a clear understanding of the particular characteristics and needs of each segment. For example, marketing strategies that are effective for new developments might not work for resales. Therefore, by not categorizing data by “Type of Sale,” the analysis loses the potential to guide targeted interventions and optimize resource allocation, potentially leading to less effective strategies and missed opportunities in the market.\nTo enhance our analysis, I’ve processed the data to categorize it by different “Type of Sale.” This categorization allows us to delve into the specific characteristics and trends of new sales, resales, and sub-sales separately.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nP3_interactive &lt;- plot_ly(data = data_cleaned, x = ~`Area (SQFT)`, y = ~`Transacted Price ($)`, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',\n                          hoverinfo = 'text',\n                          transforms = list(\n                            list(\n                              type = 'filter',\n                              target = ~Quarter,\n                              operation = '=',\n                              value = unique(data_cleaned$Quarter)[1] \n                            ),\n                            list(\n                              type = 'filter',\n                              target = ~`Type of Sale`,\n                              operation = '=',\n                              value = unique(data_cleaned$`Type of Sale`)[1] \n                            )\n                          ),\n                          text = ~paste(\"Price: \", `Transacted Price ($)`, \"&lt;br&gt;Area: \", `Area (SQFT)`, \"&lt;br&gt;Quarter: \", Quarter, \"&lt;br&gt;Type of Sale: \", `Type of Sale`)) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = 'Scatter Plot of Transacted Price vs. Area',\n         xaxis = list(title = 'Area (SQFT)'),\n         yaxis = list(title = 'Transacted Price ($)'),\n         updatemenus = list(\n           list(\n             type = \"dropdown\",\n             direction = \"down\",\n             showactive = TRUE,\n             buttons = lapply(unique(data_cleaned$`Type of Sale`), function(type) {\n               list(\n                 method = \"restyle\",\n                 args = list(\"transforms[1].value\", type),\n                 label = type\n               )\n             })\n           )\n         ),\n         sliders = list(list(\n           active = 0,\n           currentvalue = list(prefix = \"Quarter: \"),\n           steps = lapply(unique(data_cleaned$Quarter), function(q) {\n             list(\n               label = q,\n               method = \"restyle\",\n               args = list(\"transforms[0].value\", q)  \n             )\n           })\n         )))\n\n\n\n\nP3_interactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe updated interactive scatter plot enhances data analysis capabilities significantly by incorporating dropdown menus for category-based filtering, such as transaction types (New Sale, Resale, Sub Sale).

This focus on resale properties is crucial as it offers a snapshot of the market’s secondary transactions, reflecting ongoing demand and providing a real-world gauge of property values after the initial purchase. Resale data represents an essential segment of the housing market, often characterized by immediate habitability and established neighborhoods, crucial factors for many homebuyers and investors in making informed decisions.\n\n\nSale Date:\nThe Sale Date variable is crucial in housing price analysis for monitoring temporal patterns. It allows analysts to track how prices change over time, revealing trends that may correspond to economic conditions, interest rates, or seasonal fluctuations. By examining the Sale Date, one can also discern if there are particular times of the year when the market peaks or dips, which can be invaluable for both buyers looking for the best deal and sellers aiming for the optimal listing period.\nArea and Unit Price:\nOn the other hand, Area (SQM). and Unit Price ($ PSM). provide spatial and valuation metrics, respectively. The area of a property, often measured in square meters, directly influences its utility and potential for future modifications, affecting its market value. The unit price per square meter standardizes property values, making it possible to compare homes of different sizes and locations fairly. This metric is essential to understand what drives value in the housing market and to identify whether buyers are getting a reasonable price for the area they are purchasing in.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Quarter = as.yearqtr(`Sale Date`))\n\navg_price_by_quarter_resale &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Area_Category, Quarter) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Avg_Unit_Price_PSM = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\np_line_resale &lt;- avg_price_by_quarter_resale %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Avg_Unit_Price_PSM, group = Area_Category, color = Area_Category)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Quarterly Average Unit Price ($ PSM) by Area Category for Resale\",\n       x = \"Quarter\",\n       y = \"Average Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\np_line_resale_stacked &lt;- p_line_resale + facet_wrap(~Area_Category, ncol = 1, scales = \"free_y\")\n\ndata_q1_resale &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Quarter == \"2024 Q1\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = floor_date(`Sale Date`, \"month\"))\n\np_box_resale &lt;- ggplot(data_q1_resale, aes(x = Area_Category, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, fill = Area_Category)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.001) +  # Adjusting alpha for visibility\n  facet_wrap(~Month, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Monthly Unit Price ($ PSM) by Area Category for Resale (Q1 2024)\",\n       x = \"Area Category\",\n       y = \"Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\np_combined_resale &lt;- p_line_resale_stacked / p_box_resale\n\n\n\n\nprint(p_combined_resale)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the resale housing market, the quarterly average unit price per square meter (PSM) exhibits contrasting trends: smaller properties (&lt;200 SQM) are gaining value, while larger ones (≥300 SQM) show price declines, indicating a shift in consumer preferences toward more compact living spaces. The Q1 2024 box plots reveal a broad price range within each area category, especially in the largest homes, suggesting that factors like location and amenities significantly influence pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Name:\nThe variable Project.Name represents the specific housing development or project. Analyzing data by Project.Name allows for a detailed understanding of the popularity and demand for specific developments. This can highlight developers’ reputation, location desirability, and unique features of individual projects that may influence prices. Trends can emerge, such as certain developers commanding premium prices or projects in specific locations being more sought-after.\nTotal Units and Avg Unit Price PSM:\nTotal_Units and Avg_Unit_Price_PSM are key metrics for assessing supply and value. Total_Units sold provides insight into the scale of a project and its market absorption rate. High sales volumes can indicate high demand or effective pricing strategies, while low volumes may signal overpricing or less desirable attributes. Avg_Unit_Price_PSM (average unit price per square meter) offers a comparative value indicator that normalizes prices across different sizes and types of properties, reflecting the price point at which the market clears. Analyzing this alongside Total_Units can reveal if there’s a relationship between the number of units sold and the price points, potentially guiding future development and pricing strategies.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\nproject_stats &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(`Project Name` != \"N.A.\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Project Name`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Units = sum(`Number of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Sum up all units for each project\n    Avg_Unit_Price = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Calculate the average price per square meter\n    .groups = \"drop\"  # Drop the grouping\n  )\n\ntop_projects &lt;- project_stats %&gt;%\n  top_n(25, Total_Units) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total_Units))\n\nproject_order &lt;- top_projects$`Project Name`\n\ntop_projects$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(top_projects$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\nresale_data$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(resale_data$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\n\np_units &lt;- ggplot(top_projects, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = Total_Units, fill = 'steelblue')) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(y = \"Total Number of Units\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\np_price &lt;- ggplot(resale_data, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Unit Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\np_combined &lt;- p_units | p_price\n\n\n\n\np_combined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart depicts a significant lead in the total number of units sold by “Sol Acres,” suggesting a high demand or larger inventory. Other projects show a steady decrease in volume, indicating varied market preferences. The box plot showcases consistent unit price ranges within most projects, with notable premiums in “The Sail @ Marina Bay” and “Reflections at Keppel Bay,” likely due to their desirable locations or upscale amenities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data from the first quarter of 2024 shows that “Sol Acres” significantly leads in resale volumes, hinting at its market desirability, possibly due to a balance of affordability and attractive amenities. This project’s success may be a key indicator for those seeking value-for-money investments. In contrast, luxury segments like “The Sail @ Marina Bay” exhibit a wide price range, indicating a market for buyers with a taste for exclusivity and willingness to pay a premium for distinctive features.\nFor Consumers: Buyers should align their choices with their priorities: affordability may lead them to high-volume projects, while unique, high-quality features could draw them towards premium segments. When considering investment, a diversified approach that includes stable, high-volume properties and selective, high-value opportunities may offer balanced returns.\n\n\n\n\nURA releases flash estimate of 1st Quarter 2024 private residential property price index\nUnsold private housing stock on the rise ahead of ramp-up in new launches in 2024\nHDB resale prices rise 1.7%; private home prices up 1.5% in first quarter: Flash estimates"

Resale data represents an essential segment of the housing market, often characterized by immediate habitability and established neighborhoods, crucial factors for many homebuyers and investors in making informed decisions.\n\n\nSale Date:\nThe Sale Date variable is crucial in housing price analysis for monitoring temporal patterns. It allows analysts to track how prices change over time, revealing trends that may correspond to economic conditions, interest rates, or seasonal fluctuations. By examining the Sale Date, one can also discern if there are particular times of the year when the market peaks or dips, which can be invaluable for both buyers looking for the best deal and sellers aiming for the optimal listing period.\nArea and Unit Price:\nOn the other hand, Area (SQM). and Unit Price ($ PSM). provide spatial and valuation metrics, respectively. The area of a property, often measured in square meters, directly influences its utility and potential for future modifications, affecting its market value. The unit price per square meter standardizes property values, making it possible to compare homes of different sizes and locations fairly. This metric is essential to understand what drives value in the housing market and to identify whether buyers are getting a reasonable price for the area they are purchasing in.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Quarter = as.yearqtr(`Sale Date`))\n\navg_price_by_quarter_resale &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Area_Category, Quarter) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Avg_Unit_Price_PSM = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\np_line_resale &lt;- avg_price_by_quarter_resale %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Avg_Unit_Price_PSM, group = Area_Category, color = Area_Category)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Quarterly Average Unit Price ($ PSM) by Area Category for Resale\",\n       x = \"Quarter\",\n       y = \"Average Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\np_line_resale_stacked &lt;- p_line_resale + facet_wrap(~Area_Category, ncol = 1, scales = \"free_y\")\n\ndata_q1_resale &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Quarter == \"2024 Q1\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = floor_date(`Sale Date`, \"month\"))\n\np_box_resale &lt;- ggplot(data_q1_resale, aes(x = Area_Category, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, fill = Area_Category)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.001) +  # Adjusting alpha for visibility\n  facet_wrap(~Month, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Monthly Unit Price ($ PSM) by Area Category for Resale (Q1 2024)\",\n       x = \"Area Category\",\n       y = \"Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\np_combined_resale &lt;- p_line_resale_stacked / p_box_resale\n\n\n\n\nprint(p_combined_resale)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the resale housing market, the quarterly average unit price per square meter (PSM) exhibits contrasting trends: smaller properties (&lt;200 SQM) are gaining value, while larger ones (≥300 SQM) show price declines, indicating a shift in consumer preferences toward more compact living spaces. The Q1 2024 box plots reveal a broad price range within each area category, especially in the largest homes, suggesting that factors like location and amenities significantly influence pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Name:\nThe variable Project.Name represents the specific housing development or project. Analyzing data by Project.Name allows for a detailed understanding of the popularity and demand for specific developments. This can highlight developers’ reputation, location desirability, and unique features of individual projects that may influence prices. Trends can emerge, such as certain developers commanding premium prices or projects in specific locations being more sought-after.\nTotal Units and Avg Unit Price PSM:\nTotal_Units and Avg_Unit_Price_PSM are key metrics for assessing supply and value. Total_Units sold provides insight into the scale of a project and its market absorption rate. High sales volumes can indicate high demand or effective pricing strategies, while low volumes may signal overpricing or less desirable attributes. Avg_Unit_Price_PSM (average unit price per square meter) offers a comparative value indicator that normalizes prices across different sizes and types of properties, reflecting the price point at which the market clears. Analyzing this alongside Total_Units can reveal if there’s a relationship between the number of units sold and the price points, potentially guiding future development and pricing strategies.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\nproject_stats &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(`Project Name` != \"N.A.\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Project Name`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Units = sum(`Number of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Sum up all units for each project\n    Avg_Unit_Price = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Calculate the average price per square meter\n    .groups = \"drop\"  # Drop the grouping\n  )\n\ntop_projects &lt;- project_stats %&gt;%\n  top_n(25, Total_Units) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total_Units))\n\nproject_order &lt;- top_projects$`Project Name`\n\ntop_projects$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(top_projects$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\nresale_data$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(resale_data$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\n\np_units &lt;- ggplot(top_projects, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = Total_Units, fill = 'steelblue')) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(y = \"Total Number of Units\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\np_price &lt;- ggplot(resale_data, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Unit Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\np_combined &lt;- p_units | p_price\n\n\n\n\np_combined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart depicts a significant lead in the total number of units sold by “Sol Acres,” suggesting a high demand or larger inventory. Other projects show a steady decrease in volume, indicating varied market preferences. The box plot showcases consistent unit price ranges within most projects, with notable premiums in “The Sail @ Marina Bay” and “Reflections at Keppel Bay,” likely due to their desirable locations or upscale amenities."

    "text": "The data from the first quarter of 2024 shows that “Sol Acres” significantly leads in resale volumes, hinting at its market desirability, possibly due to a balance of affordability and attractive amenities. This project’s success may be a key indicator for those seeking value-for-money investments. In contrast, luxury segments like “The Sail @ Marina Bay” exhibit a wide price range, indicating a market for buyers with a taste for exclusivity and willingness to pay a premium for distinctive features.\nFor Consumers: Buyers should align their choices with their priorities: affordability may lead them to high-volume projects, while unique, high-quality features could draw them towards premium segments. When considering investment, a diversified approach that includes stable, high-volume properties and selective, high-value opportunities may offer balanced returns."

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to model, analyse and visualise network data using R.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:\ncreate graph object data frames, manipulate them using appropriate functions of dplyr, lubridate, and tidygraph, build network graph visualisation using appropriate functions of ggraph, compute network geometrics using tidygraph, build advanced graph visualisation by incorporating the network geometrics, and build interactive network visualisation using visNetwork package\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, four network data modelling and visualisation packages will be installed and launched. They are igraph, tidygraph, ggraph and visNetwork. Beside these four packages, tidyverse and lubridate, an R package specially designed to handle and wrangling time data will be installed and launched too.\nThe code chunk:\n\npacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, \n               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,\n               tidyverse, graphlayouts)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data sets used in this hands-on exercise is from an oil exploration and extraction company. There are two data sets. One contains the nodes data and the other contains the edges (also know as link) data.\n\n\nGAStech-email_edges.csv which consists of two weeks of 9063 emails correspondances between 55 employees.\n\n\n\nGAStech_email_nodes.csv which consist of the names, department and title of the 55 employees.\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, you will import GAStech_email_node.csv and GAStech_email_edges-v2.csv into RStudio environment by using read_csv() of readr package\n\nGAStech_nodes &lt;- read_csv(\"data/GAStech_email_node.csv\")\nGAStech_edges &lt;- read_csv(\"data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv\")\n\n\n\nNext, we will examine the structure of the data frame using glimpse() of dplyr.\n\nglimpse(GAStech_edges)\n\nRows: 9,063\nColumns: 8\n$ source      &lt;dbl&gt; 43, 43, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 26, 26, 26…\n$ target      &lt;dbl&gt; 41, 40, 51, 52, 53, 45, 44, 46, 48, 49, 47, 54, 27, 28, 29…\n$ SentDate    &lt;chr&gt; \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\"…\n$ SentTime    &lt;time&gt; 08:39:00, 08:39:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:0…\n$ Subject     &lt;chr&gt; \"GT-SeismicProcessorPro Bug Report\", \"GT-SeismicProcessorP…\n$ MainSubject &lt;chr&gt; \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work rela…\n$ sourceLabel &lt;chr&gt; \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Kanon.Herrero\", \"Kanon.Herr…\n$ targetLabel &lt;chr&gt; \"Isak.Baza\", \"Lucas.Alcazar\", \"Felix.Resumir\", \"Hideki.Coc…\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to perform the changes.\n\nGAStech_edges &lt;- GAStech_edges %&gt;%\n  mutate(SendDate = dmy(SentDate)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Weekday = wday(SentDate,\n                        label = TRUE,\n                        abbr = FALSE))\n\n\n\n\nTable below shows the data structure of the reformatted GAStech_edges data frame\nRows: 9,063 Columns: 10 $ source      &lt;dbl&gt; 43, 43, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 26, 26, 26… $ target      &lt;dbl&gt; 41, 40, 51, 52, 53, 45, 44, 46, 48, 49, 47, 54, 27, 28, 29… $ SentDate    &lt;chr&gt; \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\"… $ SentTime    &lt;time&gt; 08:39:00, 08:39:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:0… $ Subject     &lt;chr&gt; \"GT-SeismicProcessorPro Bug Report\", \"GT-SeismicProcessorP… $ MainSubject &lt;chr&gt; \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work rela… $ sourceLabel &lt;chr&gt; \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Kanon.Herrero\", \"Kanon.Herr… $ targetLabel &lt;chr&gt; \"Isak.Baza\", \"Lucas.Alcazar\", \"Felix.Resumir\", \"Hideki.Coc… $ SendDate    &lt;date&gt; 2014-01-06, 2014-01-06, 2014-01-06, 2014-01-06, 2014-01-0… $ Weekday     &lt;ord&gt; Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Fr…\n\n\n\nA close examination of GAStech_edges data.frame reveals that it consists of individual e-mail flow records.

It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\nBefore getting started, you are advised to read these two articles:\n\nIntroducing tidygraph\ntidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope\n\n\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\n\n\nIn the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly .E() will give you the edge data and .G() will give you the tbl_graph object itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\nGAStech_graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nGAStech_graph\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     2 星期日       5\n2     1     2 星期一       2\n3     1     2 星期二       3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.\nThe command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”.\nIt states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\nFor example,\n\nGAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4 (active)\n    from    to Weekday Weight\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1    40    41 星期六      13\n 2    41    43 星期一      11\n 3    35    31 星期二      10\n 4    40    41 星期一      10\n 5    40    43 星期一      10\n 6    36    32 星期日       9\n 7    40    43 星期六       9\n 8    41    40 星期一       9\n 9    19    15 星期三       8\n10    35    38 星期二       8\n# ℹ 1,362 more rows\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4\n     id label           Department     Title           \n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;           \n1     1 Mat.Bramar      Administration Assistant to CEO\n2     2 Anda.Ribera     Administration Assistant to CFO\n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal Administration Assistant to CIO\n# ℹ 51 more rows\n\n\nVisit the reference guide of activate() to find out more about the function.\n\n\n\n\nggraph is an extension of ggplot2, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs.\nAs in all network graph, there are three main aspects to a ggraph’s network graph, they are:\n\nnodes,\nedges and\nlayouts.\n\nFor a comprehensive discussion of each of this aspect of graph, please refer to their respective vignettes provided.\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses ggraph(), geom-edge_link() and geom_node_point() to plot a network graph by using GAStech_graph. Before your get started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.\n\nggraph(GAStech_graph) +\n  geom_edge_link() +\n  geom_node_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use theme_graph() to remove the x and y axes. Before your get started, it is advisable to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, theme_graph() makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))\n\ng + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',\n                text_colour = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggraph support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. Figures below and on the right show layouts supported by ggraph().\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below will be used to plot the network graph using Fruchterman and Reingold layout.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nlayout argument is used to define the layout to be used.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will colour each node by referring to their respective departments.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = 3))\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\nhings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_node_point is equivalent in functionality to geo_point of ggplot2. It allows for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes. In the codes chnuks above colour and size are used.\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the thickness of the edges will be mapped with the Weight variable.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 3)\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_edge_link draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes. But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument width is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother very useful feature of ggraph is faceting. In visualising network data, this technique can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes. In this section, you will learn how to use faceting technique to visualise network data.\nThere are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting, they are:\n\nfacet_nodes() whereby edges are only draw in a panel if both terminal nodes are present here,\nfacet_edges() whereby nodes are always drawn in al panels even if the node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for the edge facetting, and\nfacet_graph() faceting on two variables simultaneously.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, facet_edges() is used. Before getting started, it is advisable for you to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n\ng + facet_edges(~Weekday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses theme() to change the position of the legend.\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n  \ng + facet_edges(~Weekday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adds frame to each graph.\n\nset_graph_style() \n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n  \ng + facet_edges(~Weekday) +\n  th_foreground(foreground = \"grey80\",  \n                border = TRUE) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunkc below, facet_nodes() is used. Before getting started, it is advisable for you to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n  \ng + facet_nodes(~Department)+\n  th_foreground(foreground = \"grey80\",  \n                border = TRUE) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentrality measures are a collection of statistical indices use to describe the relative important of the actors are to a network. There are four well-known centrality measures, namely: degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. It is beyond the scope of this hands-on exercise to cover the principles and mathematics of these measure here. Students are encouraged to refer to Chapter 7: Actor Prominence of A User’s Guide to Network Analysis in R to gain better understanding of theses network measures.\n\ng &lt;- GAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  mutate(betweenness_centrality = centrality_betweenness()) %&gt;%\n  ggraph(layout = \"fr\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department,\n            size=betweenness_centrality))\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nmutate() of dplyr is used to perform the computation.\nthe algorithm used, on the other hand, is the centrality_betweenness() of tidygraph.\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that from ggraph v2.0 onward tidygraph algorithms such as centrality measures can be accessed directly in ggraph calls. This means that it is no longer necessary to precompute and store derived node and edge centrality measures on the graph in order to use them in a plot.\n\ng &lt;- GAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  ggraph(layout = \"fr\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = centrality_betweenness()))\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntidygraph package inherits many of the community detection algorithms imbedded into igraph and makes them available to us, including Edge-betweenness (group_edge_betweenness), Leading eigenvector (group_leading_eigen), Fast-greedy (group_fast_greedy), Louvain (group_louvain), Walktrap (group_walktrap), Label propagation (group_label_prop), InfoMAP (group_infomap), Spinglass (group_spinglass), and Optimal (group_optimal). Some community algorithms are designed to take into account direction or weight, while others ignore it.

    "text": "In this section, you will learn how to create a graph data model by using tidygraph package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\nBefore getting started, you are advised to read these two articles:\n\nIntroducing tidygraph\ntidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope\n\n\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\n\n\nIn the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly .E() will give you the edge data and .G() will give you the tbl_graph object itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\nGAStech_graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nGAStech_graph\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     2 星期日       5\n2     1     2 星期一       2\n3     1     2 星期二       3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.\nThe command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”.\nIt states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\nFor example,\n\nGAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4 (active)\n    from    to Weekday Weight\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1    40    41 星期六      13\n 2    41    43 星期一      11\n 3    35    31 星期二      10\n 4    40    41 星期一      10\n 5    40    43 星期一      10\n 6    36    32 星期日       9\n 7    40    43 星期六       9\n 8    41    40 星期一       9\n 9    19    15 星期三       8\n10    35    38 星期二       8\n# ℹ 1,362 more rows\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4\n     id label           Department     Title           \n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;           \n1     1 Mat.Bramar      Administration Assistant to CEO\n2     2 Anda.Ribera     Administration Assistant to CFO\n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal Administration Assistant to CIO\n# ℹ 51 more rows\n\n\nVisit the reference guide of activate() to find out more about the function."

    "text": "visNetwork() is a R package for network visualization, using vis.js javascript library.\nvisNetwork() function uses a nodes list and edges list to create an interactive graph.\n\nThe nodes list must include an “id” column, and the edge list must have “from” and “to” columns.\nThe function also plots the labels for the nodes, using the names of the actors from the “label” column in the node list.\n\nThe resulting graph is fun to play around with.\n\nYou can move the nodes and the graph will use an algorithm to keep the nodes properly spaced.\nYou can also zoom in and out on the plot and move it around to re-center it.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can plot the interactive network graph, we need to prepare the data model by using the code chunk below.\n\nGAStech_edges_aggregated &lt;- GAStech_edges %&gt;%\n  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c(\"sourceLabel\" = \"label\")) %&gt;%\n  rename(from = id) %&gt;%\n  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c(\"targetLabel\" = \"label\")) %&gt;%\n  rename(to = id) %&gt;%\n  filter(MainSubject == \"Work related\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(from, to) %&gt;%\n    summarise(weight = n()) %&gt;%\n  filter(from!=to) %&gt;%\n  filter(weight &gt; 1) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to plot an interactive network graph by using the data prepared.\n\nvisNetwork(GAStech_nodes, \n           GAStech_edges_aggregated)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, Fruchterman and Reingold layout is used.\nCode\nvisNetwork(GAStech_nodes,            GAStech_edges_aggregated) %&gt;%   visIgraphLayout(layout = \"layout_with_fr\") \nVisit Igraph to find out more about visIgraphLayout’s argument.\n\n\n\nvisNetwork() looks for a field called “group” in the nodes object and colour the nodes according to the values of the group field.\nThe code chunk below rename Department field to group.\nCode\nGAStech_nodes &lt;- GAStech_nodes %&gt;%   rename(group = Department) \nWhen we rerun the code chunk below, visNetwork shades the nodes by assigning unique colour to each category in the group field.\nCode\nvisNetwork(GAStech_nodes,            GAStech_edges_aggregated) %&gt;%   visIgraphLayout(layout = \"layout_with_fr\") %&gt;%   visLegend() %&gt;%   visLayout(randomSeed = 123)\n\n\n\nIn the code run below visEdges() is used to symbolise the edges.\n- The argument arrows is used to define where to place the arrow.\n- The smooth argument is used to plot the edges using a smooth curve.\nCode\nvisNetwork(GAStech_nodes,            GAStech_edges_aggregated) %&gt;%   visIgraphLayout(layout = \"layout_with_fr\") %&gt;%   visEdges(arrows = \"to\",             smooth = list(enabled = TRUE,                           type = \"curvedCW\")) %&gt;%   visLegend() %&gt;%   visLayout(randomSeed = 123)\nVisit Option to find out more about visEdges’s argument.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, visOptions() is used to incorporate interactivity features in the data visualisation.\n\nThe argument highlightNearest highlights nearest when clicking a node.\nThe argument nodesIdSelection adds an id node selection creating an HTML select element.\n\nCode\nvisNetwork(GAStech_nodes,            GAStech_edges_aggregated) %&gt;%   visIgraphLayout(layout = \"layout_with_fr\") %&gt;%   visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE,              nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %&gt;%   visLegend() %&gt;%   visLayout(randomSeed = 123)\nVisit Option to find out more about visOption’s argument."

It is in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\ntz field stores time zone of the source IP address.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Deriving weekday and hour of day fields\nBefore we can plot the calender heatmap, two new fields namely wkday and hour need to be derived. In this step, we will write a function to perform the task.\n\nmake_hr_wkday &lt;- function(ts, sc, tz) {\n  real_times &lt;- ymd_hms(ts, \n                        tz = tz[1], \n                        quiet = TRUE)\n  dt &lt;- data.table(source_country = sc,\n                   wkday = weekdays(real_times),\n                   hour = hour(real_times))\n  return(dt)\n  }\n\nStep 2: Deriving the attacks tibble data frame\n\nwkday_levels &lt;- c('Saturday', 'Friday', \n                  'Thursday', 'Wednesday', \n                  'Tuesday', 'Monday', \n                  'Sunday')\n\nattacks &lt;- attacks %&gt;%\n  group_by(tz) %&gt;%\n  do(make_hr_wkday(.$timestamp, \n                   .$source_country, \n                   .$tz)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  mutate(wkday = factor(\n    wkday, levels = wkday_levels),\n    hour  = factor(\n      hour, levels = 0:23))\n\nTable below shows the tidy tibble table after processing.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntz\nsource_country\nwkday\nhour\n\n\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nBG\nNA\n20\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nNA\n6\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nNA\n8\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCN\nNA\n11\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nUS\nNA\n15\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCA\nNA\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngrouped &lt;- attacks %&gt;% \n  count(wkday, hour) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\nggplot(grouped, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \ngeom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \ntheme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \ncoord_equal() +\nscale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\nlabs(x = NULL, \n     y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks by weekday and time of day\") +\ntheme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n      legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )\n\n\n\n\n\na tibble data table called grouped is derived by aggregating the attack by wkday and hour fields.\na new field called n is derived by using group_by() and count() functions.\nna.omit() is used to exclude missing value.\ngeom_tile() is used to plot tiles (grids) at each x and y position. color and size arguments are used to specify the border color and line size of the tiles.\ntheme_tufte() of ggthemes package is used to remove unnecessary chart junk. To learn which visual components of default ggplot2 have been excluded, you are encouraged to comment out this line to examine the default plot.\ncoord_equal() is used to ensure the plot will have an aspect ratio of 1:1.\nscale_fill_gradient() function is used to creates a two colour gradient (low-high).\n\nThen we can simply group the count by hour and wkday and plot it, since we know that we have values for every combination there’s no need to further preprocess the data.\n\n\n\nChallenge: Building multiple heatmaps for the top four countries with the highest number of attacks.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Deriving attack by country object\nIn order to identify the top 4 countries with the highest number of attacks, you are required to do the followings:\n\ncount the number of attacks by country,\ncalculate the percent of attackes by country, and\nsave the results in a tibble data frame.\n\n\nattacks_by_country &lt;- count(\n  attacks, source_country) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent = percent(n/sum(n))) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\nStep 2: Preparing the tidy data frame\nIn this step, you are required to extract the attack records of the top 4 countries from attacks data frame and save the data in a new tibble data frame (i.e. top4_attacks).\n\ntop4 &lt;- attacks_by_country$source_country[1:4]\ntop4_attacks &lt;- attacks %&gt;%\n  filter(source_country %in% top4) %&gt;%\n  count(source_country, wkday, hour) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(source_country = factor(\n    source_country, levels = top4)) %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Plotting the Multiple Calender Heatmap by using ggplot2 package."
