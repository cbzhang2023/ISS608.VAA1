    "text": "There are two major residential property market in Singapore, namely public and private housing. Public housing aims to meet the basic need of the general public with monthly household income less than or equal to S$14,000. For families with monthly household income more than S$14,000, they need to turn to the private residential market.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish the task, transaction data of REALIS will be used.

This focus on resale properties is crucial as it offers a snapshot of the market’s secondary transactions, reflecting ongoing demand and providing a real-world gauge of property values after the initial purchase. Resale data represents an essential segment of the housing market, often characterized by immediate habitability and established neighborhoods, crucial factors for many homebuyers and investors in making informed decisions.\n\n\nSale Date:\nThe Sale Date variable is crucial in housing price analysis for monitoring temporal patterns. It allows analysts to track how prices change over time, revealing trends that may correspond to economic conditions, interest rates, or seasonal fluctuations. By examining the Sale Date, one can also discern if there are particular times of the year when the market peaks or dips, which can be invaluable for both buyers looking for the best deal and sellers aiming for the optimal listing period.\nArea and Unit Price:\nOn the other hand, Area (SQM). and Unit Price ($ PSM). provide spatial and valuation metrics, respectively. The area of a property, often measured in square meters, directly influences its utility and potential for future modifications, affecting its market value. The unit price per square meter standardizes property values, making it possible to compare homes of different sizes and locations fairly. This metric is essential to understand what drives value in the housing market and to identify whether buyers are getting a reasonable price for the area they are purchasing in.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Quarter = as.yearqtr(`Sale Date`))\n\navg_price_by_quarter_resale &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Area_Category, Quarter) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Avg_Unit_Price_PSM = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\np_line_resale &lt;- avg_price_by_quarter_resale %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Avg_Unit_Price_PSM, group = Area_Category, color = Area_Category)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Quarterly Average Unit Price ($ PSM) by Area Category for Resale\",\n       x = \"Quarter\",\n       y = \"Average Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\np_line_resale_stacked &lt;- p_line_resale + facet_wrap(~Area_Category, ncol = 1, scales = \"free_y\")\n\ndata_q1_resale &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Quarter == \"2024 Q1\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = floor_date(`Sale Date`, \"month\"))\n\np_box_resale &lt;- ggplot(data_q1_resale, aes(x = Area_Category, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, fill = Area_Category)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.001) +  # Adjusting alpha for visibility\n  facet_wrap(~Month, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Monthly Unit Price ($ PSM) by Area Category for Resale (Q1 2024)\",\n       x = \"Area Category\",\n       y = \"Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\np_combined_resale &lt;- p_line_resale_stacked / p_box_resale\n\n\n\n\nprint(p_combined_resale)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the resale housing market, the quarterly average unit price per square meter (PSM) exhibits contrasting trends: smaller properties (&lt;200 SQM) are gaining value, while larger ones (≥300 SQM) show price declines, indicating a shift in consumer preferences toward more compact living spaces. The Q1 2024 box plots reveal a broad price range within each area category, especially in the largest homes, suggesting that factors like location and amenities significantly influence pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Name:\nThe variable Project.Name represents the specific housing development or project. Analyzing data by Project.Name allows for a detailed understanding of the popularity and demand for specific developments. This can highlight developers’ reputation, location desirability, and unique features of individual projects that may influence prices. Trends can emerge, such as certain developers commanding premium prices or projects in specific locations being more sought-after.\nTotal Units and Avg Unit Price PSM:\nTotal_Units and Avg_Unit_Price_PSM are key metrics for assessing supply and value. Total_Units sold provides insight into the scale of a project and its market absorption rate. High sales volumes can indicate high demand or effective pricing strategies, while low volumes may signal overpricing or less desirable attributes. Avg_Unit_Price_PSM (average unit price per square meter) offers a comparative value indicator that normalizes prices across different sizes and types of properties, reflecting the price point at which the market clears. Analyzing this alongside Total_Units can reveal if there’s a relationship between the number of units sold and the price points, potentially guiding future development and pricing strategies.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\nproject_stats &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(`Project Name` != \"N.A.\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Project Name`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Units = sum(`Number of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Sum up all units for each project\n    Avg_Unit_Price = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Calculate the average price per square meter\n    .groups = \"drop\"  # Drop the grouping\n  )\n\ntop_projects &lt;- project_stats %&gt;%\n  top_n(25, Total_Units) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total_Units))\n\nproject_order &lt;- top_projects$`Project Name`\n\ntop_projects$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(top_projects$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\nresale_data$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(resale_data$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\n\np_units &lt;- ggplot(top_projects, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = Total_Units, fill = 'steelblue')) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(y = \"Total Number of Units\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\np_price &lt;- ggplot(resale_data, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Unit Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\np_combined &lt;- p_units | p_price\n\n\n\n\np_combined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart depicts a significant lead in the total number of units sold by “Sol Acres,” suggesting a high demand or larger inventory. Other projects show a steady decrease in volume, indicating varied market preferences. The box plot showcases consistent unit price ranges within most projects, with notable premiums in “The Sail @ Marina Bay” and “Reflections at Keppel Bay,” likely due to their desirable locations or upscale amenities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data from the first quarter of 2024 shows that “Sol Acres” significantly leads in resale volumes, hinting at its market desirability, possibly due to a balance of affordability and attractive amenities. This project’s success may be a key indicator for those seeking value-for-money investments. In contrast, luxury segments like “The Sail @ Marina Bay” exhibit a wide price range, indicating a market for buyers with a taste for exclusivity and willingness to pay a premium for distinctive features.\nFor Consumers: Buyers should align their choices with their priorities: affordability may lead them to high-volume projects, while unique, high-quality features could draw them towards premium segments. When considering investment, a diversified approach that includes stable, high-volume properties and selective, high-value opportunities may offer balanced returns.\n\n\n\n\nURA releases flash estimate of 1st Quarter 2024 private residential property price index\nUnsold private housing stock on the rise ahead of ramp-up in new launches in 2024\nHDB resale prices rise 1.7%; private home prices up 1.5% in first quarter: Flash estimates"

    "text": "The visualizations specifically highlight resale data within Singapore’s private residential market for the first quarter of 2024. This focus on resale properties is crucial as it offers a snapshot of the market’s secondary transactions, reflecting ongoing demand and providing a real-world gauge of property values after the initial purchase. Resale data represents an essential segment of the housing market, often characterized by immediate habitability and established neighborhoods, crucial factors for many homebuyers and investors in making informed decisions.\n\n\nSale Date:\nThe Sale Date variable is crucial in housing price analysis for monitoring temporal patterns. It allows analysts to track how prices change over time, revealing trends that may correspond to economic conditions, interest rates, or seasonal fluctuations. By examining the Sale Date, one can also discern if there are particular times of the year when the market peaks or dips, which can be invaluable for both buyers looking for the best deal and sellers aiming for the optimal listing period.\nArea and Unit Price:\nOn the other hand, Area (SQM). and Unit Price ($ PSM). provide spatial and valuation metrics, respectively. The area of a property, often measured in square meters, directly influences its utility and potential for future modifications, affecting its market value. The unit price per square meter standardizes property values, making it possible to compare homes of different sizes and locations fairly. This metric is essential to understand what drives value in the housing market and to identify whether buyers are getting a reasonable price for the area they are purchasing in.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Quarter = as.yearqtr(`Sale Date`))\n\navg_price_by_quarter_resale &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Area_Category, Quarter) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Avg_Unit_Price_PSM = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\np_line_resale &lt;- avg_price_by_quarter_resale %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Avg_Unit_Price_PSM, group = Area_Category, color = Area_Category)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Quarterly Average Unit Price ($ PSM) by Area Category for Resale\",\n       x = \"Quarter\",\n       y = \"Average Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\np_line_resale_stacked &lt;- p_line_resale + facet_wrap(~Area_Category, ncol = 1, scales = \"free_y\")\n\ndata_q1_resale &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Quarter == \"2024 Q1\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = floor_date(`Sale Date`, \"month\"))\n\np_box_resale &lt;- ggplot(data_q1_resale, aes(x = Area_Category, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, fill = Area_Category)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.001) +  # Adjusting alpha for visibility\n  facet_wrap(~Month, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Monthly Unit Price ($ PSM) by Area Category for Resale (Q1 2024)\",\n       x = \"Area Category\",\n       y = \"Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\np_combined_resale &lt;- p_line_resale_stacked / p_box_resale\n\n\n\n\nprint(p_combined_resale)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the resale housing market, the quarterly average unit price per square meter (PSM) exhibits contrasting trends: smaller properties (&lt;200 SQM) are gaining value, while larger ones (≥300 SQM) show price declines, indicating a shift in consumer preferences toward more compact living spaces. The Q1 2024 box plots reveal a broad price range within each area category, especially in the largest homes, suggesting that factors like location and amenities significantly influence pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Name:\nThe variable Project.Name represents the specific housing development or project. Analyzing data by Project.Name allows for a detailed understanding of the popularity and demand for specific developments. This can highlight developers’ reputation, location desirability, and unique features of individual projects that may influence prices. Trends can emerge, such as certain developers commanding premium prices or projects in specific locations being more sought-after.\nTotal Units and Avg Unit Price PSM:\nTotal_Units and Avg_Unit_Price_PSM are key metrics for assessing supply and value. Total_Units sold provides insight into the scale of a project and its market absorption rate. High sales volumes can indicate high demand or effective pricing strategies, while low volumes may signal overpricing or less desirable attributes. Avg_Unit_Price_PSM (average unit price per square meter) offers a comparative value indicator that normalizes prices across different sizes and types of properties, reflecting the price point at which the market clears. Analyzing this alongside Total_Units can reveal if there’s a relationship between the number of units sold and the price points, potentially guiding future development and pricing strategies.\n\nCodePlotConclusion\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\nproject_stats &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(`Project Name` != \"N.A.\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Project Name`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Units = sum(`Number of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Sum up all units for each project\n    Avg_Unit_Price = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Calculate the average price per square meter\n    .groups = \"drop\"  # Drop the grouping\n  )\n\ntop_projects &lt;- project_stats %&gt;%\n  top_n(25, Total_Units) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total_Units))\n\nproject_order &lt;- top_projects$`Project Name`\n\ntop_projects$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(top_projects$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\nresale_data$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(resale_data$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\n\np_units &lt;- ggplot(top_projects, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = Total_Units, fill = 'steelblue')) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(y = \"Total Number of Units\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\np_price &lt;- ggplot(resale_data, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Unit Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\np_combined &lt;- p_units | p_price\n\n\n\n\np_combined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart depicts a significant lead in the total number of units sold by “Sol Acres,” suggesting a high demand or larger inventory. Other projects show a steady decrease in volume, indicating varied market preferences. The box plot showcases consistent unit price ranges within most projects, with notable premiums in “The Sail @ Marina Bay” and “Reflections at Keppel Bay,” likely due to their desirable locations or upscale amenities."

    "text": "3.1 Learning Outcome In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.\n3.2 Getting Started First, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive. plotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs. DT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page. tidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs. patchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure. The code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, \n               patchwork, DT, tidyverse) \n\n3.3 Importing Data In this section, Exam_data.csv provided will be used. Using read_csv() of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.\nThe code chunk below read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods ggiraph is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements. Onclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked. Data_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements. If it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic Below shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created.

Building an animation step-by-step with gganimate. Creating a composite gif with multiple gganimate panels\n4 Programming Animated Statistical Graphics with R\n4.1 Overview When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n4.1.1 Basic concepts of animation When creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n4.1.2 Terminology Before we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\nTip Before you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n4.2 Getting Started 4.2.1 Loading the R packages First, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs. gganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs. gifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame. gapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme. tidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\n               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n4.2.2 Importing the data In this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\nWrite a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n4.3 Animated Data Visualisation: gganimate methods gganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\ntransition_() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time. view_() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation. shadow_() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time. enter_()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation. ease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions. 4.3.1 Building a static population bubble plot\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Building the animated bubble plot In the code chunk below,\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year). ease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')          \n\n\n\n\n4.4 Animated Data Visualisation: plotly In Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).\n4.4.1 Building an animated bubble plot: ggplotly() method In this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using ggplotly() method.\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') + \n  theme(legend.position='none')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Building an animated bubble plot: plot_ly() method\n\nbp &lt;- globalPop %&gt;%\n  plot_ly(x = ~Old, \n          y = ~Young, \n          size = ~Population, \n          color = ~Continent,\n          sizes = c(2, 100),\n          frame = ~Year, \n          text = ~Country, \n          hoverinfo = \"text\",\n          type = 'scatter',\n          mode = 'markers'\n          ) %&gt;%\n  layout(showlegend = FALSE)\nbp\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Reference Getting Started Visit this link for a very interesting implementation of gganimate by your senior.

    "text": "3.1 Learning Outcome In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.\n3.2 Getting Started First, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive. plotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs. DT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page. tidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs. patchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure. The code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, \n               patchwork, DT, tidyverse) \n\n3.3 Importing Data In this section, Exam_data.csv provided will be used. Using read_csv() of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.\nThe code chunk below read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods ggiraph is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements. Onclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked. Data_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements. If it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides.

Creating a composite gif with multiple gganimate panels\n4 Programming Animated Statistical Graphics with R\n4.1 Overview When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n4.1.1 Basic concepts of animation When creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n4.1.2 Terminology Before we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\nTip Before you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n4.2 Getting Started 4.2.1 Loading the R packages First, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs. gganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs. gifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame. gapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme. tidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\n               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n4.2.2 Importing the data In this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\nWrite a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n4.3 Animated Data Visualisation: gganimate methods gganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\ntransition_() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time. view_() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation. shadow_() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time. enter_()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation. ease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions. 4.3.1 Building a static population bubble plot\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Building the animated bubble plot In the code chunk below,\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year). ease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')          \n\n\n\n\n4.4 Animated Data Visualisation: plotly In Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).\n4.4.1 Building an animated bubble plot: ggplotly() method In this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using ggplotly() method.\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') + \n  theme(legend.position='none')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Building an animated bubble plot: plot_ly() method\n\nbp &lt;- globalPop %&gt;%\n  plot_ly(x = ~Old, \n          y = ~Young, \n          size = ~Population, \n          color = ~Continent,\n          sizes = c(2, 100),\n          frame = ~Year, \n          text = ~Country, \n          hoverinfo = \"text\",\n          type = 'scatter',\n          mode = 'markers'\n          ) %&gt;%\n  layout(showlegend = FALSE)\nbp\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Reference Getting Started Visit this link for a very interesting implementation of gganimate by your senior.

This function stacks the data frames vertically, allowing for an analysis across all data combined. 3.Data Inspection:\nglimpse() provides a quick overview of the combined data frame, showing types of data and a preview of the first few entries in each column, helping to quickly assess the data’s structure and readiness for analysis.\n\ndata1 = read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308160536.csv\")\ndata2 = read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308160736.csv\")\ndata3 = read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308161009.csv\")\ndata4 = read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308161109.csv\")\ndata5 = read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv\")\ndata &lt;- bind_rows(data1, data2, data3, data4, data5)\n\nglimpse(data)\n\nRows: 26,806\nColumns: 21\n$ `Project Name`                &lt;chr&gt; \"THE REEF AT KING'S DOCK\", \"URBAN TREASU…\n$ `Transacted Price ($)`        &lt;dbl&gt; 2317000, 1823500, 1421112, 1258112, 1280…\n$ `Area (SQFT)`                 &lt;dbl&gt; 882.65, 882.65, 1076.40, 1033.34, 871.88…\n$ `Unit Price ($ PSF)`          &lt;dbl&gt; 2625, 2066, 1320, 1218, 1468, 1767, 1095…\n$ `Sale Date`                   &lt;chr&gt; \"01 Jan 2023\", \"02 Jan 2023\", \"02 Jan 20…\n$ Address                       &lt;chr&gt; \"12 HARBOURFRONT AVENUE #05-32\", \"205 JA…\n$ `Type of Sale`                &lt;chr&gt; \"New Sale\", \"New Sale\", \"New Sale\", \"New…\n$ `Type of Area`                &lt;chr&gt; \"Strata\", \"Strata\", \"Strata\", \"Strata\", …\n$ `Area (SQM)`                  &lt;dbl&gt; 82.0, 82.0, 100.0, 96.0, 81.0, 308.7, 42…\n$ `Unit Price ($ PSM)`          &lt;dbl&gt; 28256, 22238, 14211, 13105, 15802, 19015…\n$ `Nett Price($)`               &lt;chr&gt; \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", \"-\", …\n$ `Property Type`               &lt;chr&gt; \"Condominium\", \"Condominium\", \"Executive…\n$ `Number of Units`             &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1…\n$ Tenure                        &lt;chr&gt; \"99 yrs from 12/01/2021\", \"Freehold\", \"9…\n$ `Completion Date`             &lt;chr&gt; \"Uncompleted\", \"Uncompleted\", \"Uncomplet…\n$ `Purchaser Address Indicator` &lt;chr&gt; \"HDB\", \"Private\", \"HDB\", \"HDB\", \"HDB\", \"…\n$ `Postal Code`                 &lt;chr&gt; \"097996\", \"419535\", \"269343\", \"269294\", …\n$ `Postal District`             &lt;chr&gt; \"04\", \"14\", \"27\", \"27\", \"28\", \"19\", \"10\"…\n$ `Postal Sector`               &lt;chr&gt; \"09\", \"41\", \"26\", \"26\", \"79\", \"54\", \"27\"…\n$ `Planning Region`             &lt;chr&gt; \"Central Region\", \"East Region\", \"North …\n$ `Planning Area`               &lt;chr&gt; \"Bukit Merah\", \"Bedok\", \"Yishun\", \"Yishu…\n\n\n\n\n\nSale Date is converted to a date format using the dmy() function from the lubridate package, which interprets strings as dates in “day-month-year” format.\nArea (SQM). is transformed into a numeric variable.
